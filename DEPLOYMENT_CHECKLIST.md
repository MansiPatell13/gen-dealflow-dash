# Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Build Configuration
- [x] `netlify.toml` file created
- [x] `vite.config.ts` optimized for production
- [x] Build command: `npm run build`
- [x] Publish directory: `dist`

### ✅ Routing Configuration
- [x] `public/_redirects` file created for SPA routing
- [x] All routes fall back to `index.html`

### ✅ Security & Performance
- [x] `public/_headers` file with security headers
- [x] Caching configured for static assets
- [x] Code splitting enabled in Vite config

### ✅ Build Testing
- [x] Local build successful (`npm run build`)
- [x] `dist` directory created with all files
- [x] No build errors or warnings

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Git Repository
- [ ] Push all changes to your Git repository
- [ ] Ensure `.gitignore` excludes `node_modules` and `dist`

### 2. Netlify Setup
- [ ] Create Netlify account (if not exists)
- [ ] Connect repository to Netlify
- [ ] Configure build settings:
  - Build command: `npm run build`
  - Publish directory: `dist`
  - Node version: 18 (or latest LTS)

### 3. Environment Variables (if needed)
- [ ] Add any `VITE_*` environment variables in Netlify dashboard
- [ ] Test environment variables locally

### 4. Deploy
- [ ] Trigger initial deployment
- [ ] Check build logs for any errors
- [ ] Verify site is accessible
- [ ] Test all routes and functionality

## Post-Deployment Verification

### ✅ Functionality Testing
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] All routes work (SPA routing)
- [ ] All components render properly
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Responsive design works

### ✅ Performance Testing
- [ ] Page load times are acceptable
- [ ] Assets are properly cached
- [ ] Code splitting works correctly

### ✅ Security Testing
- [ ] Security headers are present
- [ ] No sensitive information exposed
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build fails**: Check Node.js version and dependencies
2. **Routing issues**: Verify `_redirects` file is in `public` directory
3. **Environment variables**: Ensure they're prefixed with `VITE_`
4. **404 errors**: Check that all routes fall back to `index.html`

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Test build locally
npm run build

# Preview build locally
npm run preview

# Clean build directory
npm run clean

# Type checking
npm run type-check
```

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:
1. Set up custom domain (optional)
2. Configure analytics (if needed)
3. Set up monitoring and error tracking
4. Plan backend deployment strategy
5. Set up CI/CD for automatic deployments
