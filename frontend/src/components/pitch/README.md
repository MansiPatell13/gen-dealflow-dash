## Pitch Generation Algorithm

The system uses a sophisticated content generation algorithm with the following structure:

### Content Sections
1. **Executive Summary**: High-level overview and value proposition
2. **Problem Statement**: Clear definition of challenges and requirements
3. **Solution Approach**: Methodology and phased implementation
4. **Technical Implementation**: Technology stack and architecture
5. **Timeline and Budget**: Detailed project planning and costs
6. **Expected Outcomes**: Measurable results and ROI projections
7. **Case Study Integration**: Relevant experience and success stories
8. **Call to Action**: Next steps and engagement process

### Generation Logic

```typescript
const generateSolutionPitch = async (
  brief: ProjectBrief, 
  caseStudies: CaseStudy[]
): Promise<SolutionPitch> => {
  // Filter relevant case studies (60%+ relevance score)
  const relevantCaseStudies = caseStudies
    .filter(cs => cs.relevanceScore >= 60)
    .sort((a, b) => b.relevanceScore - a.relevanceScore)
    .slice(0, 2);

  // Generate title and content
  const pitchTitle = generatePitchTitle(brief);
  const pitchContent = generatePitchContent(brief, relevantCaseStudies);

  return {
    id: Date.now().toString(),
    title: pitchTitle,
    content: pitchContent,
    status: 'draft',
    caseStudyIds: relevantCaseStudies.map(cs => cs.id),
    version: 1
  };
};
```

### Industry-Specific Content
- **Technology**: Modern tech stack (React, Node.js, AWS)
- **Healthcare**: HIPAA compliance and medical terminology
- **Finance**: Security and compliance focus
- **Retail**: E-commerce and customer experience
- **Manufacturing**: Industrial and production terminology
- **Education**: Learning and academic terminology

## Data Models

### SolutionPitch Interface
```typescript
interface SolutionPitch {
  id: string;
  briefId: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  status: 'draft' | 'submitted' | 'approved' | 'rejected';
  createdBy: string;
  createdAt: string;
  feedback?: string;
  clientEmail?: string;
  caseStudyIds?: string[];
  version?: number;
}
```

### ProjectBrief Interface
```typescript
interface ProjectBrief {
  title: string;
  industry: string;
  budget: string;
  objectives: string;
  timeline: string;
  clientDetails: string;
}
```

## API Integration

### Mock Data Functions
The system includes comprehensive mock data and API simulation:

```typescript
// Generate solution pitch
export const generateSolutionPitch = async (
  brief: ProjectBrief, 
  caseStudies: CaseStudy[]
): Promise<SolutionPitch>

// Content generation functions
const generatePitchTitle = (brief: ProjectBrief): string
const generatePitchContent = (brief: ProjectBrief, caseStudies: CaseStudy[]): string
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Pitch Generation
```tsx
import { PitchGenerator } from '@/components/pitch/PitchGenerator';

<PitchGenerator
  brief={projectBrief}
  caseStudies={relevantCaseStudies}
  onPitchGenerated={(pitch) => console.log(pitch)}
  onPitchSaved={(pitch) => console.log(pitch)}
/>
```

### Pitch Preview
```tsx
import { PitchPreview } from '@/components/pitch/PitchPreview';

<PitchPreview
  pitch={generatedPitch}
  onEdit={handleEdit}
  onApprove={handleApprove}
  onReject={handleReject}
  onDownload={handleDownload}
  onShare={handleShare}
/>
```

### Integration with Brief Workflow
```tsx
// After brief parsing and case study selection
<PitchGenerator
  brief={parsedBrief}
  caseStudies={selectedCaseStudies}
  onPitchGenerated={handlePitchGenerated}
  onPitchSaved={handlePitchSaved}
/>
```
